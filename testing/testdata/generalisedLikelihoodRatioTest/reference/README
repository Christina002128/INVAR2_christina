Taken reference from processing the files
output_R/os/PARADIGM.f0.9_s2.BQ_20.MQ_40.SLX-19721_SXTLI001.1.ptspec.0.05.combined.polished.size.os.Rdata
and output_R/PARADIGM.f0.9_s2.BQ_20.MQ_40.size_characterisation.rds
through GLRT_iterate_nonptspec.R and doing what the collection code does,
namely looking for the lines with "INVAR_SCORE" in them (yes, really).

The code should be run with:

Rscript R/GLRT_iterate_nonptspec.R | tee GLRT.out

We can then use the two scripts in this directory to manipulate the output into
the reference tables:

extractInvarScores.sh invarscore.SLX-19721_SXTLI001_PARA_002.csv

Run GLRT_iterate_nonptspec.R again with the file
output_R/os/PARADIGM.f0.9_s2.BQ_20.MQ_40.SLX-19721_SXTLI001.3.ptspec.0.05.combined.polished.size.os.Rdata

This is "patient mutation belongs to" == PARA_028

extractInvarScores.sh invarscore.SLX-19721_SXTLI001_PARA_028.csv

When we have these two files, run the R script:

Rscript tidyRef.R

It produces a trimmed version of PARA_028 using only the first iteration.
Subsequent iterations sample from the reads so are no reproducable.

Note: there is a bug in GLRT_iterate_nonptspec.R: it prints the with size
null and alt likelihoods for both rows. So the likelihoods for the execution
without size is wrong.
