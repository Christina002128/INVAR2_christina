Both inputs already exist from earlier processes. The size characterisation
file is created as part of making the references to sizeCharacterisation
(i.e. it's reference output). The sized sample mutations table is already
an input (source) for sizeCharacterisation. Now we're running GLRT on per
pool + sample + patient files, the actual source file (per patient) is made
by running in R:

t <- readRDS('SLX-19721_SXTLI001.os.rds')
t %>% filter(PATIENT_MUTATION_BELONGS_TO == 'PARA_002') %>% saveRDS('SLX-19721.SXTLI001.PARA_002.perpatient.rds')
t %>% filter(PATIENT_MUTATION_BELONGS_TO == 'PARA_028') %>% saveRDS('SLX-19721.SXTLI001.PARA_028.perpatient.rds')
