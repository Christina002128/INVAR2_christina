Both inputs already exist from earlier processes. The size characterisation
file is created as part of making the references to sizeCharacterisation
(i.e. it's reference output). The sized sample mutations tables are already
an input (source) for sizeCharacterisation.

Run them through reorganiseSizeCharacteristicsTables.R in this directory:

Rscript reorganiseSizeCharacteristicsTables.R \
PARADIGM.f0.9_s2.BQ_20.MQ_40.raw.size_characterisation.rds \
PARADIGM.f0.9_s2.BQ_20.MQ_40.size_characterisation.rds
