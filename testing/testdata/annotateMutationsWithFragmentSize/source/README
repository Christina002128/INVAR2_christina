The mutation table is created by converting PARADIGM.f0.9_s2.BQ_20.MQ_40.combined.rds.

The inserts file is taken from the original run of the pipeline,
originally named "SLX-19721_SXTLI001.FS_2.sort.filtered.bam.inserts_for_annotation.csv"
and converted with the "fromOriginal.R" script in this directory
to match the format expected in the new pipeline.
