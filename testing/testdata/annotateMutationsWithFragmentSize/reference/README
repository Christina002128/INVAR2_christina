Reference is from saving the combined.polished.size_ann data
frame in size_annotation.R (line 38) and standardising with
reorganiseMutationTable.R.

Also need to set the seed for the random number generator when
sampling in downsample_fragments from TAPAS_functions.R
(~ line 621) to make sure the picks are the same. The seed used
is 1024.
