The references here are taken from the original run's files in output_R:

PARADIGM.f0.9_s2.BQ_20.MQ_40.combined.os_0.05.rds
PARADIGM.f0.9_s2.BQ_20.MQ_40combined.outlier_suppression0.05.rds

The first is saved by the script. The second, which is the cut down table
of outlier pass before joining with the original table, needs a line uncommented
in the original script to save.

The full mutation table is processed with reorganiseMutationTable.R.

The smaller table of outlier pass or fail can be converted from the file
with this:

as_tibble(readRDS('PARADIGM.f0.9_s2.BQ_20.MQ_40combined.outlier_suppression0.05.rds')) %>%
separate(uniq, into = c('CHROM', 'POS', 'POOL', 'BARCODE'), sep='[:_]') %>%
mutate(POS = as.integer(POS)) %>%
rename(OUTLIER.PASS = PASS) %>%
arrange(POOL, BARCODE, CHROM, POS) %>%
select(POOL, BARCODE, CHROM, POS, OUTLIER.PASS) %>%
mutate(OUTLIER.PASS = ifelse(OUTLIER.PASS, 'T', 'F')) %>%
write_tsv(file = 'REFERENCE_outlierflags.fail.tsv')
