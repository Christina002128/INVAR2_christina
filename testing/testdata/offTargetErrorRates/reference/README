The original source file from Emma's run for the off target error rate
output from INVAR3 is
output_R/locus_error_rates.off_target.Rdata

The function annotate_with_locus_error_rate in TAPAS_functions.R
had to be tweaked to do the creation of the LOCUS_NOISE.PASS
column before saving the table.

The file here is created by running this file through
reorganiseLocusErrorRateTable.R with no other changes.

----------

The two error rate RData files:
PARADIGM.f0.9_s2.BQ_20.MQ_40.cosmic_FALSE.error_rates.Rdata
PARADIGM.f0.9_s2.BQ_20.MQ_40.cosmic_TRUE.error_rates.Rdata

are converted with the custom script "fromRData.R" in this directory.
