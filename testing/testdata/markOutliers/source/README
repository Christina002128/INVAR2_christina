The source information is taken by making a small modification to
size_annotation.R to save the whole data frame for SLX-19721 barcode
SXTLI001 rather than the split per sample files it originally outputs.

That is run through reorganiseMutationTable.R to create the final table.
That script can be tweaked to save the output as an RDS file, which is
what we actually want rather than the TSV. Or the TSV can be loaded and
saved as an RDS.
