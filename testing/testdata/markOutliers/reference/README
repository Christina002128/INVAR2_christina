Getting a reference needed some hacking. The original size_annotation.R
code was changed to perform a calculation of every sample in the source file
(in ../source) and to produce a table for all the samples, instead of the
sample by sample work. The addition was, after loading the RData object:

owners <- unique(combined.polished.size_ann$pt_mutation_belongs_to)

repolishForOwner <- function(owner) {
    message('Processing ', owner)
    curr <- filter(combined.polished.size_ann, pt_mutation_belongs_to == owner)
    repolish(curr, outlier_suppression_threshold_settings)
}

all <- lapply(owners, repolishForOwner)

raw <- rbindlist(all)

The resulting RData object saved ("raw") was passed through reorganiseMutationTable.R.
