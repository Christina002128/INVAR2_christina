Rdata files taken from output_R/os directory and run through this
directory's reorganiseMutationTables.R to create the RDS files.

The script combines files from the same pool + barcode pair and
writes one RDS for the pairing, not a file per input file. This
gives an input object in the same form as the task will receive
from the pipeline's own calculations in outlierSuppression.R
