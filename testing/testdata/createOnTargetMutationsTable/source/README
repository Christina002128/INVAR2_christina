This is a converted version of f0.9_s2.BQ_20.MQ_40.Rdata used
as the reference to createMutationsTable test. This already
exists as an input to offTargetErrorRates.

The error rates file is from the file
PARADIGM.f0.9_s2.BQ_20.MQ_40.cosmic_FALSE.error_rates.Rdata converted
as part of the reference creation of offTargetErrorRates.
