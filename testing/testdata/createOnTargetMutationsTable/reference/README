This one is a little tricky, as the createOnTargetMutationsTable.R
script isn't an end point in INVAR4.R. The output is the data frame
at the end of the parse() method. INVAR4.R was modified to write out
the data frame at that point to create the reference. It also needed
a modification to keep the "case_or_control" column in the data frame
(lines 371 and 380 of TAPAS_functions.R).

The data frame written out is then passed through reorganiseMutationTable.R
to rename columns and perform standard sorting.
